Pilable furniture
=================

Some open furniture design with the major 'pile up', made with openscad.

Content
=======

For each piece of furniture, you have the openscad code and the python script to generate the stl and dxf files.

Among the generated files, you find:
- The assembly in 3 variants: normal view, with exagerated space between planks and a break view (stl format).
- The assembly in dxf. The assembly is sliced along the 3 Cartesian directions.
- The stl of each type of planks and its projections along the 3 Cartesian directions in dxf.
- The list of all required solid planks and plywood slabs required to build the furniture part.

Check the doc directoy to get some clues to understand easilier the scad code.

Modular wardrobe
================

This piece of furniture is a modular wardrobe. The complete wardrobe is a pile of modules.

The module length is N times the module width. This lets you make a wardrobe with a floor trace in L.

The modularity of the wardrobe is useful to get more in freedom in his home rearrangement. The module can also be used as crate during moves. So you have small modules to carry instead of large wardrobe.

This design favours the sturdiness and cheap base material. The frame is built with solid planks. The remaining surfaces are in plywood.

This result in some complex plank designs that must be elaborated with CNC mill machine.
